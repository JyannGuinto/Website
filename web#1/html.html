        <p><strong>Poor Mobile Optimization:</strong> Users visiting the website from smartphones or tablets may have experienced usability problems, 
            such as text or image scaling issues or trouble navigating the site on smaller screens, if the website was not optimized for mobile devices.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Cluttered Interface:</strong> Users may find it more difficult to find what they're looking for and may decide to leave the 
            website as a result of the cluttered interface and disorganized product display.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Unconventional Product Presentation:</strong> Although some customers could have enjoyed the distinctive product choices, 
            others would have been turned off by the unconventional presentation, which made their shopping experience less pleasurable.

        <h2 class="header2">Content</h2>
        <p><strong>Lack of Clear Information:</strong> It was frequently difficult for customers to make educated purchasing decisions due 
            to the inadequate or unclear product descriptions and information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Unconventional Product Presentation:</strong> things were haphazardly arranged with minimal classification or arrangement, 
            which could be confusing to consumers and make it challenging to locate particular things.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Limited Search and Filtering Options:</strong> The absence of comprehensive search and 
            filtering options may have made it difficult for users to focus their search and made it more difficult for them to locate relevant products quickly.

        <h2 class="header3">Grid Layout</h2>
        <p><strong>Cluttered Interface:</strong> The homepage and other pages of the website had a cluttered interface 
            with a large number of products, which could overwhelm consumers and make it difficult for them to concentrate on particular items.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Inconsistent Design Aesthetic:</strong> The website's design aesthetic occasionally lacked coherence and was out of date, 
            which hurt the user experience overall and reduced its visual appeal.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Slow Loading Times:</strong> Customers may have been irritated and received a subpar experience as 
            a result of the excessive number of products and possibly huge image files.
